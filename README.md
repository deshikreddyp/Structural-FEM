# Structural-FEM
My own code for solving complex structural problems in 1D and 2D. When extracted find the two files one in .m format (m script) and other in .mlx format (live script). The live script file is user friendly and have special comments mentioned. It also has a user friendly dialog box interaction. 
Load one of these files in your matlab window (.mlx file is preferred), click run and Enjoy!!

Please don't hesitate to give your feedback or suggestion.
